"**#Linear SVC Classifier**

A support-vector machine constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high- or infinite-dimensional space, 
which can be used for classification, regression, or other tasks like outliers detection.[3] Intuitively, a good 
separation is achieved by the hyperplane that has the largest distance to the nearest training-data point of any class 
(so-called functional margin), since in general the larger the margin, the lower the generalization error of the classifier."
